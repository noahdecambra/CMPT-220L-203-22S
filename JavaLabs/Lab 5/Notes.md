## Solution
To create my dry solution I created an array for pretzels, lemonade, and tips. Each interger represents the customers purchase and any tips they may have given
After that I created a for loop that calculates each exchange between the customers. It does so by minusing the avaialable stock to the amount the customer purchases. And adds any tips if given.
